# Analysis-and-Prediction-of-Quality-of-Seeds

This project presents a methodology for seed quality prediction in India. Agriculture
has been the backbone of the economy. These agricultural activities remain
undeveloped due to different factors. Most of these activities are performed with a
lack of modern technology. At present, the prediction of seed quality is done based on
the knowledge of human intelligence. Therefore, the current seed prediction analysis
is inefficient and has no validation mechanism.

In this project, I have made an effort to establish a predictive model to predict seed
quality using machine learning algorithms which results in high crop production and
good quality of crops.

This model has been developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for
accurate seed classification by training it onto the seed dataset. This model is used to
learn from data that can be used to make predictions whether the seeds are of premium
quality, standard quality, or regular quality. The data used in the training model for
classification purposes consist of training data and validation data while the data used
in predictive analytics of the algorithm consist of testing data. Hence, the main
objective of the project is to achieve the optimal algorithm for the prediction of seed
quality with higher accuracy by analyzing the training accuracy of CNN model and
prediction accuracy of the algorithm.
